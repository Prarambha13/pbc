    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>Playboi Carti is more than a rapper — he's a movement. Known for his experimental sound and iconic “baby voice,” he influenced a generation of artists. His music prioritizes mood, repetition, and vibes over deep lyricism — making it infectious and memorable.</p>

    <h2>Albums</h2>

    <div class="event">
      <p><strong>Playboi Carti (2017)</strong><br>

    <div class="event">
      <p><strong>Die Lit (2018)</strong><br>
      A cult classic. With a punk-influenced vibe, *Die Lit* made Carti a legend among his fans. Songs like "Shoota," "R.I.P.," and "Long Time" made the album both chaotic and emotional. It influenced the aesthetics of hip-hop — from stage design to merch culture.<br>

    <div class="event">
      <p><strong>Whole Lotta Red (2020)</strong><br>
      Dropped on Christmas, this album was unlike anything before it. With distorted beats, demonic energy, and punk-rock influence, it was divisive but visionary. WLR inspired a rage genre, echoed by artists like Ken Carson and Destroy Lonely.<br>

      <p><strong>MUSIC (2025)</strong><br>
      Carti’s latest album dropped in early 2025 and takes everything further — industrial rage, vampy fashion, heavy bass. It’s considered his most polished yet raw work, blending digital distortion and futuristic sounds. Fans see this as a rebirth of Carti’s influence, already making waves on TikTok, festivals, and even fashion campaigns.<br>
